Question:

All numbers with specific difference
Given a positive number N and a number D, write a program to find the count of numbers smaller than N such that the difference between the number and sum of its digits is greater than or equal to given specific value D.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and D.
