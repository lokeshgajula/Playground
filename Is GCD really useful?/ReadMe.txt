Question:

Is GCD really useful?
We all know what GCD is. But, in real life, how many times have you used it at all? When you look back, do you recall days when you like a human-robot solved so many math problems on GCD? What a waste of time! Let's not sully any paper, ink or time on it anymore. Let's just write a simple algorithm that's gonna do it for us forever.
