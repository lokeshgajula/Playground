Question:

Is it a prime ðŸ¤¨?
With all the mathematical whizzes out there, you would think that detecting prime numbers would be easy. However, if you analyze, there is no magical formula to find the â€“ you can either memorize them or have the ability to recognize them. That's simply because prime numbers have no rhyme or reason. And to further boggle the mind, some numbers would appear to be prime, but they aren't. So for all those reasons, we thought its fun to write an algorithm that does the thinking on our behalf.
