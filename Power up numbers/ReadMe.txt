Question:

Power up numbers
Dice games are popular on planet X. Of course, the rules are different than the Earth version: Each die has 9 faces. And a player's score is always powered up, except for the first roll! Meaning, let's say you roll a day and get a 6, your score is 6. Now, the second time, you got a 9. Your score is 6^9. If the third time you get a 7, your score is 10077696^7 i.e (6^9)^7. The first to reach a hundred billion wins it. You see the difficulty right? The calculation indeed. Could you write an algo to help the folks on Planet X.
