Question:

Finding factors is real hard
"Mathematics is notoriously easy to teach wrong. Or else notoriously hard to teach right, if you prefer. " It's not us who told this. It's Mike's mom Mary Marcus. She is frustrated with getting Mike to finish his homework. What's mike's problem? He doesn't hate math. He just dislikes division & finds it boring. Mary needs a way out to help her son. Could you write a simple algorithm to find the factors of an inputted number? Probably that's gonna solve Mike's problem
