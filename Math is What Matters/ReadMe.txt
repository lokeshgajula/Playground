Question:

Math is What Matters
"The world is perfect without Math. All you need is programming!" The guy who said this is now busy figuring out how to check if a number is Armstrong number or not. He's been working on it for a long time now. We all disagree with him, isn't it? Writing a simple algorithm to find if a number is Armstrong or not should be a no-brainer to you. Well, then let's do it and prove him wrong.
