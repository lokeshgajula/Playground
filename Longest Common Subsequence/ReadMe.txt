Question:

Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings, return the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
