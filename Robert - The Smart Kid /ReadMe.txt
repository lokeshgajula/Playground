Question:

Robert - The Smart Kid
Robert is 5 years old. Topper at academics, sports, extracurriculars and what not. 
That's a lot of achievement for a 5-year-old kid, isn't it? Well, the fact is he's intellectually gifted. However, at school, 
he was treated no differently from others. Recently, Robert's Math teacher has given him homework to calculate the sum of n natural numbers.
While the other kids out there are finger counting, Robert decides to write an algorithm to do this. Could you help him out with this?
