Questin :
Billu Barber works at a salon. Being the owner's favourite employee, he gets to choose the appointments he wants to work on for the day. Remaining are distributed to other employees.
Each appointment has the starting time and end time for the clients and cost for the sevices. Billu obviously cannot work multiple jobs at the same time. He being smart picks 
those appointments which would maximize his earnings.
Your goal is to determine how many appointments and earnings are left for other employees once billy has chosen his appointments.
