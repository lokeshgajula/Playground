Question:

Permutations - All of Them
"I'm not a fan of having kids memorize formulas, and I'm even less of a fan of pushing them to learn those formulas," says Mr. John, 7th grade Math teacher. Maybe he has got a point. He believes in teaching the logic rather than the formula. Anyway, we aren't here to weigh/debate about his opinions. All we gotta do is help Mr. John and his students by writing an algorithm that can calculate & print all the permutations of a given number in strictly sorted order. Remember, Mr. John is gonna use your algorithm to demonstrate permutations in his next class.
