Question:

Hammer it out
Sometimes you don't need to think, you just need to hammer it out! Hear us out completely. As paradoxical as it may seem, your fingers will sometimes "remember" better than your conscious mind. That's why we sometimes ask you to code some simple mathematical logics. By doing so, you get used to the syntax and you combat laziness too ðŸ˜›. Here is one such program - Write an algorithm to find the difference between the sum of the odd terms and even terms in a given number.
